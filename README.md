This programme includes Maximum Appearing Element
Description
Our Task: Given two arrays L[ ] and R[ ] of size N where L[i] and R[i] (0 ? L[i], R[i] < 106) denotes a range of numbers, the task is to find the maximum occurred integer in all the ranges. If more than one such integer exists, print the smallest one. 
Examples: 

Input: L[ ] = {1, 4, 3, 1}, R[ ] = {15, 8, 5, 4}
Output: 4

Explanation: Overall ranges are: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 15}, {4,5,6,7,8}, {3,4,5}, {1,2,3,4}. 

In all these ranges, 4 appears the most times
